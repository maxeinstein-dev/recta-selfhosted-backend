## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Pull request template in `.github/pull_request_template.md`: test plan, commit attribution, release impact, CHANGELOG gate and how to revert.
- `CONTRIBUTING.md` with setup, the gates to pass before pushing, commit attribution and contribution rules.
- `CHANGELOG.md` (this file).
- Tests with [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/): `npm test` runs `src/**/*.test.ts` without touching the database, starting with tests for cursor pagination.
- Continuous integration on GitHub Actions: `db:generate`, `typecheck`, `build` and `vitest` on every pull request and on `main`.
