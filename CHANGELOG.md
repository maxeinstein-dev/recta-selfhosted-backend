## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Pull request template in `.github/pull_request_template.md`: test plan, commit attribution, release impact, CHANGELOG gate and how to revert.
- `CONTRIBUTING.md` with setup, the gates to pass before pushing, commit attribution and contribution rules.
- `CHANGELOG.md` (this file).
- Tests with [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/): `npm test` runs `src/**/*.test.ts` without touching the database, starting with tests for cursor pagination.
- Continuous integration on GitHub Actions: `db:generate`, `typecheck`, `build` and `vitest` on every pull request and on `main`.
- `AUTH_MODE=local`: sign-in with email and password and self-issued JWTs, with no Firebase. New public routes `POST /auth/register` and `POST /auth/login`, and `GET /auth/config` so clients can discover the mode. Requires `AUTH_JWT_SECRET` (32+ characters); `AUTH_TOKEN_TTL_HOURS` sets the token lifetime (default 720). Emails are trimmed and lowercased, passwords are 8 to 72 bytes, and both routes are limited to 10 requests per minute per IP (429 as an error object).
- `AUTH_ALLOW_REGISTRATION` (default `true`): when `false`, `POST /auth/register` answers 403, and `GET /auth/config` reports `registrationEnabled`.
- Migration `auth_mode_local`: adds `users.password_hash` (nullable) and makes `users.firebase_uid` nullable.

### Fixed

- Authentication error responses are documented in the routes' schemas as the `{ success, error: { code, message } }` object the API already returns.
- `POST /users/me/reset` and `DELETE /users/me` find the user by id in local mode instead of by Firebase UID.
