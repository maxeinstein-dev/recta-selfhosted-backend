# Recta Backend

Backend for Recta — personal finance app with household collaboration. **Open source & self-hostable.**

## About this project

Recta is an open source personal finance manager. This repository is the public backend: **anyone can self-host it**, fork it, submit pull requests, or build on top of it. Submitting PRs or contributing does **not** guarantee that any feature or change will be incorporated into the hosted product at [recta.app](https://recta.app). The maintainers decide what is merged and what is shipped on recta.app.

This project is maintained by [PrimoDev](https://www.oprimo.dev).

**Other part of the project:** [recta-selfhosted-frontend](https://github.com/oprimodev/recta-selfhosted-frontend) — web app (React/Vite).

## Tech stack

- **Node.js** 20.19+ (or 22.12+)
- **Fastify** – REST API
- **PostgreSQL** – database
- **Prisma** – ORM
- **Firebase Admin** – auth (Google, Apple, email)
- **Zod** – validation

## Hosting (self-hosted)

You can run this backend on any Node.js host. Some options:

- **[Railway](https://railway.app)** – simple deploy, PostgreSQL add-on, cron support
- **[Render](https://render.com)** – free tier, PostgreSQL, background workers
- **[Fly.io](https://fly.io)** – global regions, PostgreSQL via Supabase or external
- **[DigitalOcean App Platform](https://www.digitalocean.com/products/app-platform)** – managed app + DB
- **VPS** (Hetzner, Linode, etc.) – run `npm run start` behind Nginx and use a managed PostgreSQL (e.g. Supabase, Neon, or self-hosted)

Set `DATABASE_URL`, pick an [auth mode](#auth-mode) and, in production, `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` and optionally `SWAGGER_USERNAME`/`SWAGGER_PASSWORD`. For recurring transactions, schedule `npm run cron:process-recurrences` once per day (cron job or Railway cron).

You don't need Firebase to run a working instance — `local` auth mode plus PostgreSQL is enough.

## How to run

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 20.19+ (or 22.12+)
- PostgreSQL 16+
- Firebase project with Authentication enabled

### 1. Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 2. Environment variables

```bash
cp env.example .env
```

Edit `.env`:

| Variable | Required | Description |
|----------|----------|-------------|
| `DATABASE_URL` | Yes | PostgreSQL URL, e.g. `postgresql://user:password@localhost:5432/recta` |
| `AUTH_MODE` | Yes | `local` (no Firebase) or `firebase` (default). See below. |

#### Auth mode

Choose how users sign in via `AUTH_MODE`:

- **`local`** (recommended for self-host) — no third-party auth. The backend issues and verifies its
  own JWTs for email/password login. Requires `AUTH_JWT_SECRET` (min 32 chars; generate with
  `openssl rand -base64 48`). Optional: `AUTH_TOKEN_TTL_HOURS` (default 720 = 30 days) and `AUTH_ALLOW_REGISTRATION` (default `true`; set it to
  `false` to close sign-ups once your users exist). No Firebase setup needed.
- **`firebase`** (default) — Google/Apple/Email sign-in via Firebase. Provide credentials with one of
  the two options below. Optionally set the public `AUTH_FIREBASE_WEB_API_KEY` so `GET /auth/config`
  hands the client your web config.

Clients call `GET /auth/config` (public) to discover the mode before showing a login screen.
In `local` mode, clients use `POST /auth/register` and `POST /auth/login` (both public, return
a JWT for the `Authorization: Bearer` header). `GET /auth/me` and `POST /auth/sync` work in
both modes. `GET /auth/config` also reports `registrationEnabled`.

Local mode details worth knowing when you host it:

- Emails are trimmed and lowercased before they are stored or looked up, so `Ana@Example.com` and
  `ana@example.com` are the same account. Passwords are 8 to 72 bytes (bcrypt ignores the rest).
- Registration answers 409 for an email that is already taken, so it reveals which emails have an
  account. Login does not: a wrong password and an unknown email answer (and take) the same.
- `POST /auth/register` and `POST /auth/login` are limited to 10 requests per minute per IP. The server
  runs with `trustProxy` on, so the IP is the one in `X-Forwarded-For`: **put the app behind a reverse
  proxy that overwrites that header** (and does not expose the app port directly), otherwise a client can
  send a different value on every request and skip the limit.

**Firebase – option A (file):**

- Create a [service account](https://console.firebase.google.com/project/_/settings/serviceaccounts/adminsdk) and download the JSON.
- Save it in the project (e.g. `firebase-service-account.json`) and **do not commit** it.
- In `.env`: `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=./firebase-service-account.json`

**Firebase – option B (env vars):**

- In `.env` set: `FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID`, `FIREBASE_CLIENT_EMAIL`, `FIREBASE_PRIVATE_KEY` (private key with `\n` for newlines).

Other optional vars: `PORT` (default 3000), `REDIS_URL`, `SWAGGER_USERNAME`/`SWAGGER_PASSWORD`, `ALLOWED_ORIGINS`, `FIRST_RUN`. See `env.example`.

> In production use `npm run db:deploy` (not `db:migrate`) to apply migrations, or set `FIRST_RUN=true` on the first boot to run them automatically, then remove it.

### 3. Run migrations

```bash
npm run db:migrate
```

### 4. Start the server

**Development:**

```bash
npm run dev
```

**Production:**

```bash
npm run build
npm run start
```

API at `http://localhost:3000`. Swagger docs (when enabled): `http://localhost:3000/docs`.

### 5. Verify

```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/health
```

Returns `{ status, timestamp, uptime, apiVersion, minClientVersion }`. `apiVersion` is the self-host
contract: clients compare it against the official contract to detect a backend that has fallen behind.
If your instance reports an older `apiVersion` than the app expects, pull the latest code and redeploy
so the schema and endpoints stay in sync.

## Scripts

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `npm run dev` | Dev server with hot reload |
| `npm run build` | Production build |
| `npm run start` | Run production build |
| `npm run db:migrate` | Run migrations (dev) |
| `npm run db:deploy` | Run migrations (production) |
| `npm run db:studio` | Open Prisma Studio |
| `npm run db:generate` | Generate Prisma Client |
| `npm run lint` | Lint |
| `npm run typecheck` | Type check |
| `npm test` | Unit tests (Vitest, no database needed) |

## Recurring transactions (cron)

To process recurring transactions daily, run as a cron job:

```bash
npm run build
npm run cron:process-recurrences
```

Schedule this once per day (cron, systemd, or your host’s scheduler).
