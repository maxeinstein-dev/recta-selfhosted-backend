# Recta Backend

Backend for Recta — personal finance app with household collaboration. **Open source & self-hostable.**

## About this project

Recta is an open source personal finance manager. This repository is the public backend: **anyone can self-host it**, fork it, submit pull requests, or build on top of it. Submitting PRs or contributing does **not** guarantee that any feature or change will be incorporated into the hosted product at [recta.app](https://recta.app). The maintainers decide what is merged and what is shipped on recta.app.

This project is maintained by [PrimoDev](https://www.oprimo.dev).

**Other part of the project:** [recta-selfhosted-frontend](https://github.com/oprimodev/recta-selfhosted-frontend) — web app (React/Vite).

## Tech stack

- **Node.js** 20.19+ (or 22.12+)
- **Fastify** – REST API
- **PostgreSQL** – database
- **Prisma** – ORM
- **Firebase Admin** – auth (Google, Apple, email)
- **Zod** – validation

## Hosting (self-hosted)

You can run this backend on any Node.js host. Some options:

- **[Railway](https://railway.app)** – simple deploy, PostgreSQL add-on, cron support
- **[Render](https://render.com)** – free tier, PostgreSQL, background workers
- **[Fly.io](https://fly.io)** – global regions, PostgreSQL via Supabase or external
- **[DigitalOcean App Platform](https://www.digitalocean.com/products/app-platform)** – managed app + DB
- **VPS** (Hetzner, Linode, etc.) – run `npm run start` behind Nginx and use a managed PostgreSQL (e.g. Supabase, Neon, or self-hosted)

Set `DATABASE_URL`, pick an [auth mode](#auth-mode) and, in production, `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` and optionally `SWAGGER_USERNAME`/`SWAGGER_PASSWORD`. For recurring transactions, schedule `npm run cron:process-recurrences` once per day (cron job or Railway cron).

You don't need Firebase to run a working instance — `local` auth mode plus PostgreSQL is enough.

## How to run

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 20.19+ (or 22.12+)
- PostgreSQL 16+
- Firebase project with Authentication enabled

### 1. Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 2. Environment variables

```bash
cp env.example .env
```

Edit `.env`:

| Variable | Required | Description |
|----------|----------|-------------|
| `DATABASE_URL` | Yes | PostgreSQL URL, e.g. `postgresql://user:password@localhost:5432/recta` |
| `AUTH_MODE` | Yes | `local` (no Firebase) or `firebase` (default). See below. |

#### Auth mode

Choose how users sign in via `AUTH_MODE`:

- **`local`** (recommended for self-host) — no third-party auth. The backend issues and verifies its
  own JWTs for email/password login. Requires `AUTH_JWT_SECRET` (min 32 chars; generate with
  `openssl rand -base64 48`). Optional: `AUTH_TOKEN_TTL_HOURS` (default 720 = 30 days),
  `AUTH_REQUIRE_EMAIL_VERIFICATION` (default `false`). No Firebase setup needed.
- **`firebase`** (default) — Google/Apple/Email sign-in via Firebase. Provide credentials with one of
  the two options below. Optionally set the public `AUTH_FIREBASE_WEB_API_KEY` so `GET /auth/config`
  hands the client your web config.

Clients call `GET /auth/config` (public) to discover the mode before showing a login screen.

**Firebase – option A (file):**

- Create a [service account](https://console.firebase.google.com/project/_/settings/serviceaccounts/adminsdk) and download the JSON.
- Save it in the project (e.g. `firebase-service-account.json`) and **do not commit** it.
- In `.env`: `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=./firebase-service-account.json`

**Firebase – option B (env vars):**

- In `.env` set: `FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID`, `FIREBASE_CLIENT_EMAIL`, `FIREBASE_PRIVATE_KEY` (private key with `\n` for newlines).

Other optional vars: `PORT` (default 3000), `REDIS_URL`, `SWAGGER_USERNAME`/`SWAGGER_PASSWORD`, `ALLOWED_ORIGINS`, `FIRST_RUN`. See `env.example`.

> In production use `npm run db:deploy` (not `db:migrate`) to apply migrations, or set `FIRST_RUN=true` on the first boot to run them automatically, then remove it.

### 3. Run migrations

```bash
npm run db:migrate
```

### 4. Start the server

**Development:**

```bash
npm run dev
```

**Production:**

```bash
npm run build
npm run start
```

API at `http://localhost:3000`. Swagger docs (when enabled): `http://localhost:3000/docs`.

### 5. Verify

```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/health
```

Returns `{ status, timestamp, uptime, apiVersion, minClientVersion }`. `apiVersion` is the self-host
contract: clients compare it against the official contract to detect a backend that has fallen behind.
If your instance reports an older `apiVersion` than the app expects, pull the latest code and redeploy
so the schema and endpoints stay in sync.

## Scripts

| Command | Description |

## Recurring transactions (cron)

To process recurring transactions daily, run as a cron job:

```bash
npm run build
npm run cron:process-recurrences
```

Schedule this once per day (cron, systemd, or your host’s scheduler).

## Importing bank statements

Two endpoints under `/transactions/import` import a bank statement in two steps. Both require authentication and EDITOR+ on the household that owns the destination account (which must be active), accept files up to 5 MB (JSON bodies up to 1 MB) and at most 5000 rows. Requests over the limits answer 413.

| Endpoint | Body | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `POST /transactions/import/preview` | multipart: `accountId`, `file` (.ofx or .csv) | Parses the file without persisting anything. Each row is flagged `duplicate` when the account already holds it. Lines that could not be read are listed in `skipped` (`line`, `reason`; `skippedCount` has the total) so nothing disappears silently. |
| `POST /transactions/import/confirm` | JSON: `{ accountId, rows: [{ date, description, amount, type }] }` | Creates the rows through the regular transaction service (balances are updated); rows already on the account are skipped. |

**Duplicates are counted, not just detected.** A row is the same transaction when type, day, amount and description match, and the file is compared to the account by occurrence: if the file has two identical coffees and the account has one, the first is a duplicate and the second is new. Identical rows with different `FITID`s in an OFX are both kept; a `FITID` repeated inside one file is skipped (`repeated-id`). Preview and confirm use the same rule, so importing the same file twice is safe. No identifier is stored with the transaction, so there is no migration; the match is on the transaction's own fields.

**Known limitation: no stored import id.** Because the match is on the transaction's own fields, a legitimate purchase that has the same type, day, amount and description as one already on the account (for example, two overlapping statements that both contain a "Coffee 10.00" on the same day, where the second one is a different purchase) shows up as a duplicate and the preview offers no override. The user can add that transaction manually. A future import reference stored with each transaction (an additive migration) would tell the two apart. The frontend sends the whole file on confirm and the server applies the same rule as the preview, so the two always agree.

**Confirm is not atomic.** Confirms on the same account run one at a time (a per-account advisory lock), so two parallel requests cannot import the same file twice. Each row is saved by the regular transaction service, which has its own database transaction, so a failure in the middle keeps the rows already saved: the answer then carries `stoppedAt` (index of the failing row) and `error`. Sending the same rows again continues from there, because the saved ones now count as duplicates.

**OFX.** `CHARSET:1252` (or any non-UTF-8 file) is decoded as Windows-1252, XML entities in memos are decoded, and only the calendar day of `DTPOSTED` is used (the time and zone are dropped), stored as that day. A credit card invoice (`CCSTMTRS`) is read like any other file but the preview answers with the `card-statement` warning: invoices have their own flow and should not be imported as a plain statement.

**CSV.** The header is optional. With a header, the date, description and amount columns are found by name (`date`/`data`, `description`/`descricao`/`historico`, `amount`/`valor`...) in any order and extra columns are ignored. Without a header (or with a three-column header that has other names) the columns are date, description and amount and a line with any other number of columns is skipped. The delimiter is `;` if the first line has one, otherwise `,`; double quotes are honoured. Dates are `dd/MM/yyyy`, `dd-MM-yyyy` or `yyyy-MM-dd`, with an optional time that is ignored. Amounts: `1.234,56` and `1,234.56` are read by the last separator; a single separator followed by one or two digits is the decimal mark; one followed by exactly three digits (`1.234`) is ambiguous and the line is skipped (`ambiguous-amount`) rather than guessed. Negative amounts (`-`, trailing `-` or parentheses) become expenses; more than two decimals are rounded to cents.
